Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.


it is creational design pattern(creation of objects)
when a class has multiple properties and most of them are optional properties 
then in constructor we have to unnecessarily pass multiple parameters
or we have to unnecessarily create multiple constructors
builder design pattern is  used here

step by step objects are created
director is a layer which calls methods of builder class in specific order
