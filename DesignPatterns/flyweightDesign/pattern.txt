it is structural design pattern
this pattern reduces memory usage by sharing data among multiple objects

where to use this pattern:
1. memory is limited
2. when objects share the data
2.1 intrinsic data: shared among objects and remain same once defined one value
2.2 extrinsic data: changes based on client input and differs from one object to another
3. creation of objects is expensive


How to solve issue:
1.  from object, remove all extrinsic data and keep intrinsic data(this objects is called flyweight object)
2.  this flyweight class can be immutable
3.  extrinsic data can be passed to flyweight class in method parameter
4.  once flyweight object is created, it is cached and reused whenever required


in word processor, we cannot create separate class for each character 
since each character have high probability of being same
for each character character,font type, size can be same
