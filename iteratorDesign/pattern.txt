beavioural design pattern
it provides a way to access element of a collection sequentially without 
exposing underlying representation of collection

there can be many concreteIterator in the diagram attached 
aggregate is also an interface which collects the data 
in java collection interface is the aggregator
concrete iterator is classes like queue, arraylist etc
in out case library is concrete iterator


Role of the Aggregator
Holds the Collection: The Aggregator acts as a container for the collection of elements.
Creates the Iterator: It provides a method to create an instance of the Iterator that can traverse its elements.
Encapsulates Collection Logic: It abstracts the implementation details of how the collection is stored, ensuring users interact with the collection through a consistent interface.
