2 approach to manage seats: 

1. we create flight_seats table and each seat will be present multiple times based on flight_id.
2. we use booking tables to find available seats for a flight and store available seats in cache

Approach 1.
Tables:

aircraft
aircraft_id,model,total_seats

seat
seat_id,aircraft_id,seat_number,class

flight
flight_id,flight_number,aircraft_id,source_airport,destination_airport,departure_time,arrival_time,status

passenger
passenger_id,name,email,phone

flight_seat
flight_seat_id,flight_id,seat_id,seat_number,class,status (AVAILABLE / BOOKED / BLOCKED / MAINTENANCE),price

booking
booking_id,passenger_id,flight_id,booking_time,status,total_price

booking_seat
booking_id,flight_seat_id

Approach 2:

aircraft
aircraft_id,model,total_seats

seat
seat_id,aircraft_id,seat_number,class

flight
flight_id,flight_number,aircraft_id,source_airport,destination_airport,departure_time,arrival_time,status

passenger
passenger_id,name,email,phone

booking
booking_id,passenger_id,flight_id,booking_time,status,total_price

booking_seat  (this table is used because one booking can have multiple seats) seat_id,flight_id combination must be unique
booking_id,seat_id,flight_id,price_per_seat (optional)
